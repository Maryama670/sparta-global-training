Chunking Strategies
Every strategy takes a document and returns a list of chunks.

A chunk is a dict:
    - id        "<doc id>#<two-digit-number>, kept stable for the same input
    - doc_id    the parent document, used for citations
    - title     the parent documents title
    - text      exactly what gets embedded and what the model will read

    The office has underperformed against its original business case and is under review. It employs 38 lawyers, against the 60 forecast when it opened. Revenue per lawyer is the lowest in the firm.
